# CompaniON: Web Application for Companion Rentals

CompaniON is a web application aimed at fostering meaningful social connections and providing companionship services to individuals in Lipa City. The platform helps users who may struggle with social anxiety by offering structured and safe ways to engage with hired companions for various activities.

## Features Completed

### 1. *User and Companion Authentication*
   - Users and companions can register and log in to the platform.
   - A Know Your Customer (KYC) process ensures that all users and companions are verified by admins before they can access full functionality.
   
### 2. *Admin Dashboard*
   - Admins can manage users and companions via a dedicated dashboard.
   - *Analytics and Insights:*
     - View top-rated companions and places based on user feedback.
     - Track the number of visits and engagements within the system.
     - Access other key analytics to monitor system activity and user behavior.
   - *Verification Management:*
     - Admins can verify or reject users and companions after reviewing their details through the KYC process.

### 3. *Booking System*
   - Users can book verified companions for various activities, with an integrated booking history feature visible to both users and companions.
   - Admins can approve or reject bookings based on verification and availability.

### 4. *Place and Event Management*
   - Users, companions, and admins can view places and events available for bookings, ensuring the platform supports a wide range of engagement opportunities.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions Applied

### 1. *User Authentication and Verification*
   - *Challenge:* Implementing a smooth and secure KYC process was initially challenging, especially in differentiating between user roles (users vs. companions).
   - *Solution:* We created separate interfaces for users, companions, and admins, while utilizing dynamic tables to track booking history, approvals, and other key actions. The use of a separate table for companions helped streamline the verification process.

### 2. *Merging Code from Different Team Members*
   - *Challenge:* The team faced difficulties during code merging due to differing styles and approaches to solving problems.
   - *Solution:* To tackle this, we used *Live Share on Visual Studio Code*, which allowed team members to collaborate in real-time, minimizing merge conflicts and ensuring a smoother integration process.

### 3. *Responsive Design and UI Consistency*
   - *Challenge:* Ensuring that the platform maintained a consistent, user-friendly layout across different devices was tricky, especially for mobile users.
   - *Solution:* We used Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach along with custom CSS to ensure that key sections like the booking and event pages were responsive, enhancing usability on both mobile and desktop.

## Next Steps Planned

### 1. *Companion Review System*
   - We plan to add a review and rating system for companions, allowing users to provide feedback and helping admins to ensure quality control.

### 2. *Enhanced Data Analytics*
   - Expanding the analytics dashboard to provide more detailed insights for admins on platform usage, user engagement, and companion activity.

### 3. *Event-Based Bookings*
   - Implementing a feature to allow users to book companions specifically for events, including corporate gatherings, social meetups, or personal activities.

### 4. *User Interface Enhancements*
   - Continued work on improving the UI design to ensure ease of use and an engaging experience for users.
